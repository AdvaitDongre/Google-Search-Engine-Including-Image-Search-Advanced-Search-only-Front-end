# Google Search Clone

This project is a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a Google search page and two additional pages: "Images" and "Advanced Search". The project aims to replicate the basic functionality and appearance of Google's search engine.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three HTML files and their corresponding CSS files:

1. `index.html` and `index.css`: This file represents the main Google search page, including the search bar and links to Gmail, Images, and Advanced Search.

2. `images.html` and `images.css`: This file simulates the Google Images search page, allowing users to search for images or paste image URLs.

3. `advanced.html` and `advanced.css`: This file replicates the Google Advanced Search page, providing options for more advanced search queries.

## Features

- The main Google search page (`index.html`) includes a search bar with "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons, as well as links to Gmail, Images, and Advanced Search.

- The "Images" page (`images.html`) mimics the Google Images search page, allowing users to upload images or paste image URLs for searching.

- The "Advanced Search" page (`advanced.html`) replicates Google's advanced search options, including searching by specific words, exact phrases, language, region, and more.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the HTML files in a web browser. You can interact with the search bars, buttons, and links as you would on the actual Google search page.

## Acknowledgements
